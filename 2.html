<img src="coding.jpg" width="100%">
<p> One is by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which maintains a specification for HTML as a modularized "living standard" at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/. The second is at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). A series of snapshots of well-supported modules have been compiled and published as W3C Recommendations: 5.0 (2014); 5.1 (2016); 5.2 (2017), with future snapshots expected. The latest W3C Recommendation is at the URL https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/. See Notes below for more on the relationship between W3C and WHATWG.</p>
